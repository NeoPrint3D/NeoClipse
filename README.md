## Description 📕

NeoClipse is a fully autonomous AI agent that generates short-form videos using Open Source AI tools from across the web

## Warning Highly Experimental ⚠️
Currently, this is a repo that uses lots of local tools so there is no elegant setup script

### Tasks to implement 🚦
- Replace Poe API with ollama and mistral:instruct
- Find a way to use Stable Diffusion API with the infinite zoom extension
- Possibly dockerize the entire application and have a single docker-compose for easy local setup
- Clean up the large thick python
- Find a new way to get background music instead of relying on MusicLM
-
